            <p>
                Hello! My name is Vilas Dasalkar. I'm currently working as an Associate Software Developer at Revature India. 
                I have a strong background in Java Spring Boot, Maven, and MySQL, and I'm passionate about software development and cybersecurity. 
                I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new technologies to expand my skill set. 
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tools and techniques in the tech industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey into technology started with a keen interest in how things work, which led me to pursue a career in software development. 
                I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for opportunities to grow both professionally and personally. 
                I'm excited about the future of technology and look forward to contributing to innovative projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my technical skills, I value teamwork, collaboration, and effective communication, which I believe are crucial in any successful project. 
                I am always open to new challenges and enjoy working in dynamic environments where I can make a meaningful impact.
            </p>
